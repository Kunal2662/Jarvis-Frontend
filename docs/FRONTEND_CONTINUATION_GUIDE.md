# JARVIS Frontend Continuation Guide

## Purpose

This file exists so a new Emergent workspace, Emergent account, Claude Code session, Cursor session, or another coding agent can continue the JARVIS frontend without rediscovering the project.

## Read these files first

Before making changes, read in this order:

1. `docs/JARVIS_CORE_MILESTONES.md`
2. `docs/JARVIS_FRONTEND_ARCHITECTURE.md`
3. `docs/JARVIS_CORE_FRONTEND_MAPPING.md`
4. `docs/FRONTEND_IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md`
5. `README.md`

## Project identity

This is the **NEW JARVIS frontend checkpoint**.

It is NOT the old frontend inside the main `Jarvis-OS` repository.

The frontend is intended to become the modern presentation layer for JARVIS Core.

## Current stop point

Per the authoritative continuation state in `docs/FRONTEND_PROGRESS.md` (§11):

**LAST COMPLETED FRONTEND STEP:** Step 19 — Settings (`/settings`, a new `SettingsService` seam — `settingsService.ts` — owning exactly one real, `localStorage`-persisted preference, `notificationsEnabled`). A genuine architectural distinction was made before writing any code: Settings is the **user-facing configuration surface for systems that already exist**, not a second copy of any of them. Appearance stays owned by the pre-existing `ThemeProvider` (the same engine `QuickSettings` already used) — no second theme engine. Voice, Smart Home, AI Apps, Memory, Agents, and Automations tabs are each a read-only summary over that feature's own existing service with a link to its real page — no duplicated catalog, no second connect/execute/CRUD surface. Notifications is the one genuinely interactive, `SettingsService`-backed control: toggling it actually empties `AppLayout`'s notification bell menu and hides its unread badge (verified live in the browser and via an end-to-end regression test) — not a fake toggle. `SettingsProvider` (mounted in `main.tsx`) is deliberately non-throwing outside its provider (unlike `useTheme()`) so the dozens of pre-existing feature test files that render `<App/>` without it keep passing unchanged. The pre-existing `/settings` module entry (present since Step 2 as a `surface: 'settings'` placeholder) flipped from `status: 'planned'` to `'live'` — no new module entry needed. No Developer Mode surface, no AI provider/credential management, no connector connect/disconnect UI. No verified Core Settings contract was found in this repository — see `docs/CORE_SETTINGS_CONTRACT_REQUIRED.md`.

**NEXT FRONTEND STEP:** Diagnostics + Performance UI (`docs/FRONTEND_IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md` Phase 8, item 20 — the next unstarted item now that item 19 Settings is complete. Explicitly marked "contract dependent" on the roadmap; no Core contract is documented anywhere in this checkpoint — verify before implementing, per the roadmap's standing rule.).

Do not start Diagnostics + Performance UI automatically when merely reading this document — wait for explicit approval/instruction, and re-read `docs/FRONTEND_PROGRESS.md` first.

## Golden rules

### 1. Do not rebuild existing work

The project already contains a design system, App Shell, Home, Chat and Voice.

Inspect before replacing.

### 2. Core is the source of truth

If a capability belongs to JARVIS Core, integrate with the real Core contract.

Do not recreate it in React.

### 3. Never invent APIs

If the API/event contract is unknown:

- inspect the Core
- document the dependency
- stop or use a clearly marked placeholder

Never invent an endpoint just to make a UI work.

### 4. One task at a time

Use:

```text
READ → VERIFY → PLAN → IMPLEMENT → TEST → REVIEW → STOP
```

Do not implement multiple roadmap steps in one request unless explicitly approved.

### 5. Preserve architecture

Reuse:

- design-system primitives
- existing patterns
- AppShell
- WorkspaceContainer
- CommandPalette
- existing feature structure
- existing API/client conventions

Avoid duplicate components.

### 6. Don't duplicate AI logic

The Core owns:

- intent
- context
- planning
- tool selection
- permissions
- execution
- orchestration
- provider logic

The frontend owns:

- presentation
- interaction
- local UI state
- streaming display
- navigation
- user controls

### 7. Don't fake backend functionality

If Core is not ready, use:

- placeholder
- disabled state
- unavailable state
- explicit development-only mock

Never present a mock as production Core capability.

## Credit conservation

This project may be developed using limited Emergent credits.

Therefore:

- avoid broad audits when a targeted check is sufficient
- avoid unnecessary dependency changes
- avoid large refactors
- avoid regenerating the whole project
- avoid rebuilding working components
- don't run expensive work without a reason
- make changes in small, reviewable units

## Testing

After meaningful changes, run the smallest relevant validation first.

Then run broader checks when the task warrants them:

- TypeScript
- lint
- Vitest
- production build

For Core integrations, verify the actual contract and failure states.

## Git discipline

Do not commit or push unless explicitly requested.

Before a commit:

- inspect diff
- verify only intended files changed
- verify tests/build
- confirm no secrets
- confirm no generated noise
- confirm no unrelated refactoring

## Core milestone synchronization

The milestone documents are snapshots.

If Core advances, update:

1. `JARVIS_CORE_MILESTONES.md`
2. `JARVIS_CORE_FRONTEND_MAPPING.md`
3. `FRONTEND_IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md`

Do not silently change milestone status based on assumptions.

## Current priority

The planned order begins:

1. Single Workspace — done
2. Navigation & Routing — done
3. Global UI Infrastructure — done
4. Chat → AgentOrchestrator — frontend seam done, Core integration pending
5. Voice → AgentOrchestrator — frontend seam done, Core integration pending
6. Automations — frontend done (mock adapter), Core integration pending
7. Search — frontend done (mock adapter), Core integration pending
8. Knowledge + Intelligence — frontend done (local/static mock adapters), Core integration pending
9. AI Apps + Integrations — frontend done (in-memory mock adapter, one combined MCP-tool + connector catalog surface), Core integration pending
10. M11 Productivity — Notes, Tasks + Projects, Calendar, Files + Workspace — frontend done (four independent in-memory mock adapters), Core integration pending
11. M12 Smart Home — Smart Home Command Center (Step 13) + Device Management (Step 14) + Home Assistant + MQTT (Step 15) — frontend done in full (in-memory mock adapters, normalized room/device/scene entities, additive `updateDevice`/`removeDevice`/`pairDevice` + health/diagnostics on the `SmartHomeService` seam, plus a new `ConnectorService` seam for connector status/config/diagnostics), Core/Home Assistant/MQTT integration pending
12. Memory — frontend done (in-memory mock adapter, read-only recall list + detail + forget via a new `MemoryService` seam), Core memory integration pending
13. Agents — frontend done (in-memory mock adapter, observability + local enable/disable via a new `AgentService` seam, no run/execute action per "no second agent framework"), Core AgentOrchestrator integration pending (Step 17)
14. Settings — frontend done (one real `SettingsService`-backed preference, `notificationsEnabled`, persisted to `localStorage`; every other tab reads an existing feature's own service directly), Core settings/preferences integration pending ← just completed (Step 19); next up is Diagnostics + Performance UI (Phase 8, item 20)

Only proceed to the next item after the previous one has been reviewed.

## Important development-backend note

The uploaded frontend checkpoint includes an Emergent-compatible FastAPI development backend and `/api/chat/stream`.

That backend is useful for frontend development, but it is not the final JARVIS Core.

Do not silently replace it or claim it is the complete Core.

## Completion standard

A frontend feature is not considered complete merely because the UI renders.

For Core-backed features, completion means:

- correct Core mapping
- real contract integration
- loading state
- empty state
- error state
- unavailable/permission state where relevant
- cancellation/reconnect handling where relevant
- tests
- production build compatibility

## If uncertain

Stop and report the uncertainty.

Do not guess.
